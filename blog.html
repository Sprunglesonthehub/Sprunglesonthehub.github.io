            <p>What makes me qualified? Well, you are here, aren't you? Keep reading and let me know what you think. You can reach me over on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23mentalhealtharttulos:matrix.org">Matrix.</a></p>
            <p>I am ordinarily objective about my documentation. I will do my best to try to be that way with my posts here. Each post I make will be backed by sites and references, so consider this a database of knowledge.</p>
            <p>Many people I am involved with in one way or another suffer from some level of mental health issues. But more importantly I struggle with mental health issues myself, and have for most of my life.</p>
            <p>If you feel as if this is going to be a strong topic, you are <strong>absolutely correct</strong>. Why are we talking abou this? Well, because the mental health care system in the United States is absolute garbage and doesn't properly teach the public on how to talk to, or tolerate, the average person with mental health concerns.
            <p>When it comes to living with Schizophrenia, and Bipolar 1, it may be hard, but I don't look for sympathy from others for it. Why? It's just a label at the end of the day. Have you taken a moment to consider if anything has changed in the last year, or even in the last three years, or do you remember?</p>
            <p>Sorry if I scared you a bit there. Memory problems are part of the results of constant (or many) manic episodes a lot of them time. And the average population (including mental professional care) say "that is enough of an existence". For me, that never has been nore will be, enough.</p>
            <p>What do I strive for? I want real independence. Not that I want to drive, or go out to eat alone; no. I want the ability to make my own decisions in regards to my health. The ability to say "That medication provides to many side effects, let's try something else", or heck, even offer the ability have natural alternatives as well. That works for some.</p>
            <p>So maybe by offering guidance here, we can work together to provide the resources for each other to get the information we need to find the answers we are wanting, because doctors are not going to provide that for <strong>US</strong>. We have to remember that we are the most important one, as we are the ones who live the life with something of which we never asked for.</p>
            <p>So if I haven't scared you off yet, please stick around! I will make sure to have informational resources, as well as other feedback/summaries of which you can read for more information on ways to treat mental health, and information you can take to your doctor.</p>
            <p><i>Warning: I am not a mental health professional, just somebody who has lived a life of hardship and want to avoid that for many. Love you all! </i></p>

                    <p>
                        So, you are probably in a similar boat that I was in when I was 17. I learned that I had Bipolar 1 disorder, which explained a lot of my behavioral problems, but it all happened after a crisis event. You aren't only scared about what happened, but you are afraid of the future,
                        as there are so many horror stories from the internet of what happens when you go on psychiatric medications. Let's stop us there for a second. I'm not going to beat around the bush. The next year, or maybe longer, is going to be hard, but I know you are strong. You may be lucky
                        and find the right medication for you that works right away. You might not. It's a learning process. The best thing you can do is learn about yourself, learn how to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpm.12243"> read your own behavioral patterns </a>. Why is this important?
                        Bipolar, and many other psychiatric conditions come with some level of behavioral changes (or involuntary mood swings, etc). If you are able to learn how it feels when you are about to explode, cry, get angry, etc, you can prepare for the wave that is about to come. Before doing any of this, just find a therapist.
                        Many therapists don't accept insurance like medicaid, medicare, etc. But, here is a list for those who need a <a href="https://locator.apa.org/">>resource</a> to find a therapist, or a psychologist. Why is this important? Many of us with some kind of behavioral illness struggle with life skills, interacting with others, and much more.
                        By having somebody there to help assist us with everyday life functioning, we are setting ourselves up for success. Also, it means that we are reaching out for the help we need, which encourages them to be more likely to accept us as a patient. Also remember that there are other things that happen in a psychologist, pscyhiatrist, or therapist's office
                        including treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy, and many others, that may help us learn to live with our condition. This is <strong>NOT</strong> giving up on ourselves. This is giving ourselves <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0447.2004.00411.x">the ability to succeed</a>, as our lives are simply harder than the average persons. And we are given the cards we are dealt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       This is going to be the first of a million of these explanations, so please, if you are so inclined, head back here tomorrow. Please remember to take care of yourself, in all the ways you can.
                       Can shower? Okay. Then wash your hair. Can't eat? Have a snack instead. Do what you can, love yourself, and stay safe.
                       With warm Regards, and remember I'm someone just like you.

                        So, do you live with acute mental illness on the Bipolar or Schizophrenia sphere of illnesses? Well, I do. So I figured I should share some research that might just show you that people ARE studying the illness. I know that at times I get paranoid and sad, and think that people are just letting us exist without thinking about us. It's time I go ahead and prove us both wrong! First, I'm going to reference <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0020764020934827">this article</a> to show you
                        that even within the last five years, they have been doing research on what is known as psychosocial therapy. Remember when I mentioned <i>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</i>? That is a form of psychosocial therapy. It allows for assistance to treat things like Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia. It allows for us to talk about our problems, and find solutions that will allow us to <strong>be set up for success</strong>. The world may be hard with the conditions we have, but we most certainly have a place in it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Have you ever felt as if across the board behavioral therapy, medication management, etcetera, is not working? Some doctor here in the United States have thought so too! Take a look at <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-76817-001">this article</a>. It talks about how metacogntive approaches for psychological therapy can help people. In other words, an individualized approach could help people! I'm glad that they are looking into this! Amazing!

                         Ever felt like science, or medicine, is trapped in the past? Me too! In <a href="https://mental.jmir.org/2022/2/e28502">this article</a> they talk about how Virtual Reality can help those with schizophrenia. Please, give it a reed. I know I got a lot of hope from it.

                <p class="post-meta">Published on: <time datetime="2025-06-03">June 07, 2025</time></p>

                            <p>What makes me qualified to call out the bullshit? You‚Äôre still here, aren‚Äôt you? That alone tells you I'm not afraid to speak truth to power, or to the masses. And let's be real, the US mental healthcare system hasn't exactly blossomed into a beacon of empathy by June 2025, has it? You know how to reach me over on Matrix.</p>

                            <p>My aim? To keep this space a goddamn <strong>UNFILTERED DATABASE OF KNOWLEDGE</strong>. Every insight, every reference, every raw truth ‚Äì it's here, backed by facts, to arm <em>us</em>.</p>

                            <p>I've laid it all out before. My brain? It‚Äôs been a goddamn war zone for decades. Schizophrenia, Bipolar 1 ‚Äì these aren't just clinical terms, they're the blueprint of my daily grind. And I'm not alone. So many of us are still fighting for basic human dignity, for understanding, for the simple right to <em>exist</em> without apology.</p>

                            <hr>

                            <h3><strong>THE "TARNISH" THEY SEE: WHAT IT FEELS LIKE IN JUNE 2025</strong></h3>

                            <p>Let's get blunt about it. When the average person looks at us, those of us with mental health diagnoses, a shocking number of them don't see individuals. They see a <strong>tarnish on society</strong>. A problem. A burden. Something to be managed, hidden, or preferably, just <em>gone</em>.</p>

                            <p>Why are we <em>still</em> having to talk about this in 2025? Because that insidious mindset hasn't shifted nearly enough.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>The Invisible Wall:</strong> You feel it, don't you? That subtle shift in conversation when you disclose, or even when they <em>suspect</em>. The immediate downgrade in their perception of your competence, your reliability, your very worth. You become "the one with issues," not "just a person." It‚Äôs a goddamn invisible wall that keeps us perpetually on the outside.</li>
                                <li><strong>The "Problem" to be Solved (By Someone Else):</strong> We're not seen as people needing support; we're a <em>societal problem</em> to be contained. You ever notice how quickly the conversation turns to "are you taking your meds?" or "have you seen a therapist?" ‚Äì not out of genuine concern, but out of a desperate need to outsource our struggles, to make <em>us</em> someone else's responsibility? It's a deflection, plain and simple. We're a loose thread they want snipped.</li>
                                <li><strong>The Scrutiny & Suspicion:</strong> Every mood swing, every moment of quiet, every lapse in memory (thanks, manic episodes) ‚Äì it‚Äôs scrutinized through the lens of our diagnosis. "Is it <em>because</em> of your Bipolar?" "Are you <em>acting</em> out your Schizophrenia?" This constant, exhausting suspicion strips away our individuality and reduces us to symptoms. It's dehumanizing, and it perpetuates the idea that we are fundamentally unpredictable and, therefore, unsafe.</li>
                                <li><strong>Blocked Doors, Closed Minds:</strong> This isn't just about feelings. This "tarnish" mindset has real-world consequences. Job interviews where your disclosure (or even just an awkward moment) slams the door. Housing opportunities that evaporate. Relationships that falter under the weight of stigma. The system <em>still</em> fails to properly educate the public, and by doing so, it <em>perpetuates</em> this damned prejudice. They'd rather sweep us under the rug than invest in true integration and understanding.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>For me, being viewed as a "tarnish" has been a consistent, infuriating undertone of my existence. It‚Äôs why the average person, and even many "professionals," still think "that's enough of an existence" for us. But for me, that has <em>never</em> been, nor will it ever be, enough.</p>

                            <hr>

                            <h3><strong>RECLAIMING OUR SHINE: REAL INDEPENDENCE</strong></h3>

                            <p>I'm not asking for pity. I'm demanding <em>recognition</em>. The power to define ourselves, outside of their narrow, fearful gaze. Not just the independence to make my own damn coffee, but the deeper, more profound independence of controlling my own narrative, my own health, my own life.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>The strength to push back when someone's prejudice dims your light.</li>
                                <li>The resources to educate <em>them</em>, not just ourselves.</li>
                                <li>The knowledge to dismantle their preconceived notions with facts and lived experience.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Because when the world <em>still</em> insists on seeing us as flawed, it‚Äôs on <em>us</em> to prove them wrong. We are the ones living this life, a life we didn't ask for, but one we <em>can</em> redefine, one brilliant, unapologetic truth at a time.</p>

                            <hr>

                            <h3><strong>STICK AROUND. SHINE BRIGHTER.</strong></h3>

                            <p>If I haven't scared you off with the brutal truth of what we face, then please, <strong>stick around!</strong> I'm going to keep digging, keep pulling together the informational resources, the sharp insights, and the direct feedback you need. This isn't just about my story; it‚Äôs about building a collective force that refuses to be tarnished.</p>

                            <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> I am not a mental health professional. Just someone who has navigated a life of serious hardship and wants to help light the way for as many of you as possible.</p>

                            <p>Love you all!</p>
