My brother is the reason I keep pushing forward; his strength and spirit inspire me daily to strive for excellence. In 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to meet my biological dad. He has been incredibly accepting of me and who I am, and I am grateful to now be collaborating with him on various projects, including this website. My family, in all its forms, is my greatest strength and motivation.</p>
